C# is similar Java, but probably better (unless you're insane), and is generally seen as "good enough" to prevent true F# adoption.

* Curly brances
* Semicolons
* LINQY
* Asyncy (and soon to be in yer main)
* The dev lead is a powershell master
* F# is for math and science lol

```csharp
public static string BooleanToString(bool value)
{
    string ret = null
    if (value == true)
    {
         ret =  "True";
    }
    else
    {
         ret =  "False";
    }
    
    return ret;
}
```

You can have your wacky ideas about how C# needs typeclasses to survive denied in the [C# Language Design repository.](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang).

C# is also developed alongside its more sensible partner, Visual Basic .NET, in the [Roslyn repository](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn).  Llamas will be seen there.
